# dominant_colour
 Python script for finding dominant colour of an image.

 This script will calculate the most dominant colour of an image and save it with the hue appended to the beginning of the name of the file. 
 It will do this for every .jpg in a given folder and save them to a new folder. 
 You can choose to save a duplicate of the images with the colours clustered as per Kmeans processing, so you can see its effect, into a new folder of your choice.
 Finally it will calculate the size of the final image and "paste" in the sorted images in order as per their hue.
